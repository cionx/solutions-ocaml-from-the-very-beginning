# Question 3.4

> For each of the previous three questions, comment on whether you think it is easier to read the function with or without pattern matching.
> How might you expect this to change if the functions were much larger?

We find the pattern-matching version harder in each of the previous three cases.
For larger programs, pattern matching is probably more readable.
